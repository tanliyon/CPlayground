<h1>Tower of Hanoi</h1>
<p>The Tower of Hanoi Problem is a classic problem to introduce the power of recursion. Here's an example: https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html</p>
<p>When solving the puzzle, recursion offers an elegant induction solution by extending the solution for the base case up to a more complex scenario. Attempting to solve this puzzle without recursion is possible but it will be hard.</p>
<p>Currently, the program takes in only one input, the number of disks, and it will print out the exact steps to solve the puzzle.</p>
<h2>Modifications</h2>
<li>Allow the program to customise the number of poles.</li>
<li>Graphically render the solutions out.</li>
